# YouCore - Streetwear and Footwear Brand Website

**YouCore** is a modern, responsive website designed for a streetwear and footwear brand. The project is built using **HTML**, **SCSS**, and **JavaScript**, and utilizes **Webpack** and **Handlebars** for efficient templating and development.

**Live Demo**: Check out the website [here](https://abhayshah1810.github.io/hackathonDeploy/)

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later is recommended)

   cd hackathonSubmission
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Build the project for production**:

## Design Documentation

This section outlines the design decisions made during the development of the YouCore website.

### Color Schemes

- **Primary Palette**: The color scheme is heavily inspired by modern streetwear aesthetics. Key colors include vibrant shades like purple for primary actions, which evoke creativity and energy and gives a minimalistic yet modern look.
- **Backgrounds**: Muted tones such as grays and whites are used for backgrounds to create a balanced hierarchy, allowing the vibrant colors to stand out without overwhelming the user.
- **Accent Colors**: Accent colors are used strategically to highlight important UI elements like buttons and links, improving overall interaction and engagement.

### Component Architecture

- The website follows a modular component architecture, ensuring that all components are reusable throughout the site. This promotes both design consistency and code maintainability.
- SCSS is used for styling, enabling features like nesting, variables, and mixins, which make the styling more readable and maintainable.
- Each component is encapsulated with its own styles and scripts, allowing easy updates and maintenance without affecting other components.

### Responsive Design

- The website is designed with responsiveness in mind to ensure a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes, i.e. mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Media queries adjust layouts and styles for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, ensuring accessibility and visual appeal.
- Flexbox and CSS Grid systems are employed to create flexible and adaptive layouts that look great on all screen sizes and for better code understandibility

### User Experience (UX)

- **User-centric Design**: The design prioritizes user experience, focusing on clear navigation and intuitive interaction, good for a frontend client side app
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, links, and other interactive elements are easily identifiable and accessible.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Hover effects and loading indicators are used to provide feedback to the user about their interactions and the system's responses.
